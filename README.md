# Mckinley & Rice React Coding Challenge

> Welcome to the Mckinley & Rice Coding Challenge!


## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens and an API feed.  We will also assess the **generated HTML, CSS, and JS** output.

This challenge is expected to take about 2-4 hours.



# 15 Puzzle Challenge
This challenge is designed to help us understand how you write code. The execution is intentionally open and there's no one right way to solve it. Focus on the code as the visual appearance will not be under review.
